# CodeShield AI

LLM-powered Vulnerability Detection for AI-Generated Open Source Code.

This Next.js application provides a suite of tools to enhance code security, especially for code generated by AI assistants.

## Features

- **Vulnerability Scanner**: Detects common vulnerabilities, explains them in plain English, and suggests AI-powered fixes.
- **Malware Detector**: Scans code for malicious patterns like trojans and viruses.
- **Phishing Detector**: Analyzes text from emails or code comments to identify potential phishing attempts.
- **GitHub Integration**: (Coming Soon) Scan repositories and pull requests directly from GitHub.

## Getting Started

### Environment Variables

Before you begin, you will need to configure your environment variables. The application uses Genkit to connect to Google AI services, which requires an API key.

1.  **Create a `.env.local` file** by copying the example file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env.local
    ```
2.  **Get your API Key**: Obtain your Gemini API key from Google AI Studio.
3.  **Update `.env.local`**: Open the `.env.local` file and replace `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual key.

### Running the Development Server

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) with your browser to see the result.

You can start by exploring the different tools in the sidebar.

### Deploying to Production (e.g., Vercel)

When you deploy your application to a platform like Vercel, you must set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` in the project's environment variable settings in the Vercel dashboard.
